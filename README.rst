What is it?
===========

This Python package defines a `PlantUML <http://plantuml.com/>`__ cell
magic for IPython. It lets you generate UML diagrams as inline SVG in
your notebook. I'll add embellishments as needed. But, for now, I just
needed something that worked and existed as a package (in pypi).

I based my code on `Steven Burke <https://github.com/sberke>`__'s
`plantuml
gist <http://chickenbit.com/blog/2014/10/inline-plantuml-diagrams-in-ipython-notebook/>`__.

Installation
------------

First, install IPlantuml with pip.

.. code:: sh

    pip install iplantuml

Then, install plantuml. On Debian based system you can install plantuml
package. Otherwise you can download ``plantuml.jar`` and copy it to
``/usr/local/bin/plantuml.jar``.

.. code:: sh

    sudo apt install plantuml

Alternatively you can set a custom path for plantuml.jar during
installation

.. code:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/jbn/IPlantUML.git
    cd IPlantUML
    python setup.py install iplantuml --jarpath /my/custom/path/plantuml.jar

Usage
-----

In Ipython, first,

.. code:: python

    import iplantuml

then, create a cell like,

::

    %%plantuml --jar

    @startuml
    Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
    Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
    @enduml

The output will be the generated SVG UML diagram using the plantuml.jar on your local system. To utilise remote rendering on plantweb omit the `--jar` argument:

::

    %%plantuml

    @startuml
    Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
    Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
    @enduml

To specify an alternative plantuml jar path one can also use the `-p` switch:

::

    %%plantuml

    @startuml --jar -p /usr/share/plantuml/plantuml.jar
    Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
    Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
    @enduml

Further one can use the `PLANTUMLPATH` environment variable to set the
plantuml.jar path.

By default, the magic removes the intermediate (``tmp.uml``) and target
(``tmp.svg``) files. However, if you enter a name in the ``%%plantuml``
line, it retains both files of ``$name.uml`` and ``$name.svg``. For
example,

::

    %%plantuml auth

    @startuml
    Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
    Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
    @enduml

generates and retains ``auth.uml`` and ``auth.svg``.
